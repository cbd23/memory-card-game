## Memory Card Game

<a href="https://memory-card-game-lilac.vercel.app/" target="_blank">üïπ Live Demo here</a>


### Introduction
This memory game is the second project I built using **React**, and the main purpose was to understand how **useEffect()** works, since this is one of the most used React hooks.

Also, this is the first time when I implemented the Fisher-Yates algorithm, which can be used for shuffling a finite sequence.

About the actual game, there is one simple aim - to click as many cards as you can, without clicking the same card twice. And, to make it a little bit more challenging, the cards change their order after each click.

In order to display the actors' photo and name inside the cards, I used the API provided by The Movie Database (TMDB). I'm making a call that's fetching the most popular 12 actors, so the list of cards updates every day.

### Technologies
I created this project using:
- **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**
- **REACT**
- **Vite** as local development server 
- **Vercel** for deployment
- **npm** for dependency management
